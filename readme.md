## My process

- My first step was to build the HTML content. 
- The next step was to add the css classes to the HTML elements.
- I used a mobile first approach where I rendered the data according to the designs provided for a 375px wide mobile screen.
- Once the mobile screen was setup, I used media queries to make the style changes for the necessary css classes for a 1440px wide screen.
- The last step was to make the javascript file which included the Javascript functions to make the buttons work when the user clicks on them.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
  
### What I learned

- The challenge helped me recollect some of the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- Used a bit of flexbox and media queries to render the content across platforms
  
### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow for the buttons](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - This helped me write the box shadows for the next and previous buttons
- [CSS Background property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-position.asp) - This helped me position the background image properly.
